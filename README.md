# Lectures, Books and References

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some of these are not introductory, if you're new, consult a better roadmap or resource list rather than use these as entry points

This is just for me, if it helps you along the way, that's great.

Topics Covered: Data Science, Deep Learning, Generative AI, Computer Vision, NLP, IR, ML, RL, Optimization, Statistics, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Systems, Security, and Startups.

## Lectures
Most of these are offered throughout the years, you'll need to look for the lectures on YouTube yourself but I'll link the course site.
